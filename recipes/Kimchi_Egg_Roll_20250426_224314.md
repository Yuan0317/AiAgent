# Kimchi Egg Roll

## Ingredients:
- 2 eggs
- 1/2 cup kimchi, chopped
- 1 green onion, thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup carrots, julienned
- 1/4 cup onion, finely chopped
- 1/4 cup mushrooms, sliced
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Cooking oil

## Instructions:
1. **Prepare the Filling:**
   - Heat a pan over medium heat and add a little cooking oil.
   - Add the onions, carrots, and mushrooms. Stir-fry for about 3-4 minutes until the vegetables are slightly tender.
   - Add the chopped kimchi and green onions. Cook for another 2 minutes. Season with soy sauce, salt, and pepper.

2. **Make the Egg Mixture:**
   - In a bowl, beat the eggs and season with a pinch of salt.
   - Add the sesame oil to the egg mixture and mix well.

3. **Cook the Egg Roll:**
   - Heat a non-stick pan over medium-low heat and add a little oil.
   - Pour half of the egg mixture into the pan, swirling to coat the bottom evenly.
   - Cook for a minute until the edges start to set. Place half of the kimchi filling on one side of the egg.
   - Using a spatula, gently fold the other side of the egg over the filling to create a roll. Cook for another minute until the egg is fully cooked.
   - Repeat the process with the remaining egg mixture and filling.

4. **Serve:**
   - Transfer the cooked egg rolls to a cutting board and slice them into bite-sized pieces.
   - Serve hot with a side of steamed rice and extra kimchi.

## Cooking Tips:
- Be gentle when folding the egg to avoid breaking it.
- Adjust the seasoning of the filling to suit your taste preferences.
- You can also add some cooked rice or protein like shrimp or chicken to make the dish more substantial.

## Estimated Time:
- Preparation: 10 minutes
