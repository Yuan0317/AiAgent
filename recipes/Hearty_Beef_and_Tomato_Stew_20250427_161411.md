# **Hearty Beef and Tomato Stew**

## **Ingredients:**
- 1 lb beef stew meat, cubed
- 2 large tomatoes, diced
- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 carrots, sliced
- 2 celery stalks, chopped
- 4 cups beef broth
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

## **Instructions:**
1. **Prepare the ingredients**: Start by preparing all the vegetables - dice the tomatoes, chop the onion, mince the garlic, slice the carrots, and chop the celery stalks.
   
2. **Brown the beef**: In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the beef stew meat cubes and brown them on all sides. Remove the beef from the pot and set aside.

3. **Sauté the vegetables**: In the same pot, add the chopped onion and garlic. Sauté until fragrant, then add the diced tomatoes, carrots, and celery. Cook for a few minutes until the vegetables start to soften.

4. **Add the beef back**: Return the browned beef to the pot with the vegetables. Stir to combine.

5. **Season the stew**: Pour in the beef broth and add the dried thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine all the ingredients.

6. **Simmer the stew**: Bring the stew to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cover the pot and let it cook for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the beef is tender and the flavors have melded together.

7. **Adjust seasoning**: Taste the stew and adjust the seasoning if needed. You can add more salt and pepper according to your preference.

8. **Serve**: Once the stew is ready, ladle it into bowls and serve hot. You can garnish with fresh herbs like parsley if desired.

## **Cooking Tips:**
- For a richer flavor, you can sear the beef in batches before starting the stew.
- Feel free to add more vegetables like potatoes or peas for extra heartiness.
- If you prefer a thicker stew, you can mix a tablespoon of cornstarch with cold water and stir it into the stew during the last 15 minutes of cooking.

## **Estimated Time:**
- **Preparation Time:** 15 minutes
- **Cooking Time:** 1.5 to 2 hours
