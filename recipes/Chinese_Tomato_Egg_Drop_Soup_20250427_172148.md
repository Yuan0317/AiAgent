# Chinese Tomato Egg Drop Soup

## Ingredients:
- 4 eggs
- 2 medium-sized tomatoes
- 4 cups chicken or vegetable broth
- 1/2 cup milk
- 2 green onions, thinly sliced
- 1 tsp soy sauce
- Salt and white pepper to taste
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 tsp sesame oil (optional)

## Instructions:
1. **Prepare the Ingredients:**
   - Beat the eggs in a bowl and set aside.
   - Peel the tomatoes and cut them into small pieces.
   - Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat.

2. **Cook the Tomatoes:**
   - Add the tomatoes to the pot and cook until they start to soften, about 3-4 minutes.

3. **Add Broth and Seasonings:**
   - Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth and bring it to a gentle simmer.
   - Season with soy sauce, salt, and white pepper to taste.

4. **Create Egg Ribbons:**
   - Slowly pour the beaten eggs into the simmering broth in a steady stream while stirring gently with chopsticks or a fork.
   - The eggs will cook and form delicate ribbons in the soup.

5. **Add Milk and Green Onions:**
   - Stir in the milk to create a creamy texture.
   - Add half of the sliced green onions and let the soup simmer for another 2-3 minutes.

6. **Finish and Serve:**
   - Drizzle with sesame oil if using and garnish with the remaining green onions.
   - Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.

## Cooking Tips:
- Be gentle when adding the eggs to create beautiful ribbons instead of large clumps.
- Simmer the soup gently to prevent the eggs from becoming tough.
- Use ripe tomatoes for the best flavor in the soup.

## Estimated Time:
- Preparation: 10 minutes
- Cooking: 15 minutes
- Total: 25 minutes
