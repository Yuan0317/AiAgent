### **Ingredients:**
- 4 eggs
- 1 1/2 cups milk

### **Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Egg Mixture:**
   - Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl and gently beat them.
   - Slowly pour in the milk while whisking until well combined.
   - Season the mixture with a pinch of salt.

2. **Strain the Mixture:**

4. **Steam the Custard:**
   - Place the ramekins in a steamer over boiling water.

   - Garnish with some chopped scallions or a drizzle of soy sauce if desired.
   - Serve the silky egg custard hot as an appetizer or side dish.

### **Cooking Tips and Tricks:**
- Be gentle when mixing the eggs and milk to avoid creating air bubbles in the custard.
- Straining the mixture is crucial for achieving a smooth and silky texture.
- Ensure the water in the steamer is gently simmering to prevent the custard from overcooking.
- You can customize the custard by adding ingredients like minced shrimp, diced mushrooms, or even crab meat for extra flavor.
