# **Silken Egg Custard with Soy Sauce Glaze**

## Ingredients:
- 4 eggs
- 1 cup water
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 green onion, thinly sliced
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch
- Salt and white pepper to taste

## Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Custard Mixture:**
   - In a mixing bowl, crack the eggs and beat them gently.
   - Add water, salt, and white pepper. Mix well to combine.

2. **Strain the Mixture:**
   - Strain the egg mixture through a fine sieve to achieve a silky texture without any lumps.

3. **Steam the Custard:**
   - Grease small heatproof bowls or ramekins with oil.
   - Pour the egg mixture into the bowls, filling them about 3/4 full.
   - Cover the bowls with aluminum foil to prevent water from dripping onto the custard.
   - Place the bowls in a steamer over high heat.
   - Steam for about 10-15 minutes until the custard is just set but still slightly jiggly.

4. **Prepare the Soy Sauce Glaze:**
   - In a small saucepan, combine soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and cornstarch.
   - Cook over low heat, stirring constantly until the sauce thickens.

5. **Serve the Dish:**
   - Carefully remove the bowls from the steamer.
   - Drizzle the soy sauce glaze over the custard.
   - Garnish with sliced green onions.

## Cooking Tips and Tricks:
- For a smoother custard texture, you can strain the egg mixture multiple times.
- Be careful not to overcook the custard as it will become tough and lose its delicate texture.
- Adjust the seasoning of the soy sauce glaze to suit your taste preferences.
