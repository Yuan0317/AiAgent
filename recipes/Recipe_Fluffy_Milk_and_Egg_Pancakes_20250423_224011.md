# Recipe: Fluffy Milk and Egg Pancakes

## Ingredients:
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 cup milk
- 1 large egg
- 2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

## Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Batter:**
   - In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
   - In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract.
   - Gently fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps are okay.

2. **Cook the Pancakes:**
   - Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat.
   - Lightly grease the skillet with butter or cooking spray.
   - Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake.
   - Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancake, then flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes or until golden brown.
   - Repeat with the remaining batter.

3. **Serve Warm:**
   - Stack the fluffy pancakes on a plate.
   - Serve with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, fresh berries, or a dollop of whipped cream.

## Cooking Tips and Tricks:
- For extra fluffy pancakes, let the batter rest for about 10 minutes before cooking. This allows the gluten in the flour to relax, resulting in a lighter texture.
- To keep the pancakes warm while cooking the rest, place them on a baking sheet in a low oven (around 200°F or 95°C) until ready to serve.
- If you prefer a richer flavor, you can substitute some of the milk with buttermilk or yogurt.

## Estimated Time:
- Preparation: 10 minutes
- Cooking: 15 minutes
- Total Time: 25 minutes
